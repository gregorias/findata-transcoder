New GTCs since 01/07/2022
Our new General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) entered into force on 1 July 2022. They already apply since the beginning of the contract for new
customers whose cards were sent after 1 May 2022. The main changes: 1. Electronic communication. The GTCs can be viewed online at any time.
We may inform you of any amendments electronically in future, e.g. by email, SMS or via the app. 2. Compensation to banks. We may
compensate your bank for services such as distribution and customer service. Such compensation will be payable exclusively to the bank. The
customer waives any right to claim reimbursement. 3. Sharing of information. We may disclose information regarding your card transactions to
your bank. The bank may use such information for its own purposes within the framework of its privacy policy.
Tips for carefree travel
In advance of your trip, double-check that your credit card is working properly and is not about to expire. Note down the phone number of the
24-hour card cancellation centre: +41 (0)58 958 83 83. The "one" digital service gives you full control over your card all the time from any
location - and, with the "one" app, even when you're on the go. More information is available at viseca.ch/one
